# JaggyJiggy

JaggyJiggy is an 3D engine ispired in Unity, developed for an motors asigment by three students from CITM-UPC University from the degree of Design and development of Videogames.
With this engine you can make your own games from scratch! 
Has a family friendly interface in which a small physics engine has been developed in which you can see the collisions between different objects, forces which are applied to it, etc.

# Core Subsystems

## GameObjects

GameObjects are entities structured after the Entity Component Structure, they can have the following components:

+ Transform -> Represents, changes & allows to edit a gameobject position, rotation and scaling.

+ Mesh -> A 3D mesh that can be printed out to screen.

+ Material -> An image that can be applied to a mesh, using its UV channel to properly apply to the mesh.

+ Camera -> A camera that can have its values customized and used to display the scene.

+ Collider -> A collider and physics simulator that allows to change the collider shape.

## Resource Manager 

The Resource Manager is in charge of managing the GameObjects and components resources, such as the images, the 3D models, etc. If we had the same texture 2 times loaded in the scene for instance, the Resource Manager will make sure that we donâ€™t load again.

When a user drops a file to the engine, the resource manager will load the files with information and the own format files that we need.

## UI

The UI was done using ImGui and provides an editor to use and tweak all the facilities of the engine (from an engine user perspective). The module that manages the UI does so in a way that makes it incredibly easy to create and fast.

# Assigment sub-systems

+ Each element in the town generate a Box Collider.

+ The Game camera shoot Sphere Colliders that interact with other colliders correctly from a physics view.

+ A car is generated in the engine, which can be controlled by a the player. This car interacts with other colliders in the scene.

# How to use

- Open "JaggyJiggy.exe" to start.
- Then choose to drag and drop a FBX or choose any of our geometry.
- With that "object" created, select him and move, rotate or scale.

## Controls

- Left click in Object: Select object.
- WASD: Movement.
- Movement + SHIFT: speed x2.
- F: focus the camera around the selected object.
- Mouse wheel + Alt: Zoom.
- 1: Create and shot a ball.
- Esc: Close the engine.
